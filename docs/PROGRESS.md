# StockRoom — Build Progress Log

Tracks what shipped each day against the 14-day plan in `PRD.md#11`. The
daily autonomous build session reads this file to know where to resume and
appends a new entry when it finishes.

## Day 1 — 2026-08-14

**Planned:** Repo scaffold, PRD, DB schema, auth (F1/F2), Products/Categories CRUD.

**Shipped:**
- Monorepo scaffold: `backend/` (Node/TS/Express/Prisma), `frontend/`
  (React/Vite/TS), `python-service/` (FastAPI), `docs/`.
- PRD v0.1 committed.
- Prisma schema: Organization, User, Category, Supplier, Customer, Location,
  Product, InventoryItem, StockMovement, PurchaseOrder(+Line),
  SalesOrder(+Line) — full multi-tenant model from section 5.
- Auth: signup (creates Organization + Owner User), login, JWT middleware,
  role guard (OWNER/STAFF).
- Products + Categories CRUD, tenant-scoped.
- Backend unit tests for auth and products.
- Python FastAPI service skeleton with a health check and DB read connection.
- React app shell: routing, auth pages, API client, protected routes.

- GitHub Actions CI running backend tests, python-service tests, and the
  frontend production build on every push.
- All three test/build steps verified locally: backend 13/13 Jest tests
  pass, python-service pytest passes, frontend `tsc -b && vite build`
  succeeds cleanly.

**Next (Day 2):** Locations, Suppliers, Customers CRUD; InventoryItem model
wired to real stock queries per location.

**Blockers/decisions carried forward:**
- No Docker/Postgres available in the dev sandbox that built Day 1, so
  backend tests run against an in-memory Prisma mock rather than a real
  database — this is intentional (fast, no infra dependency) but true
  integration coverage against Postgres should still happen in CI or a
  real dev machine before this ships to a customer.
- react-router-dom pinned to v7 (not v6) after `npm audit` flagged a
  moderate CVE in v6 with no v6 backport available.

## Day 2–6, and a slice of Day 7 — 2026-08-14

**Planned:** Day 2 (Locations/Suppliers/Customers CRUD, InventoryItem stock
queries) through Day 6 (low-stock alerts, dashboard) of the build plan.

**Shipped (backend, F3-F9 all now live):**
- Locations, Suppliers, Customers: full tenant-scoped CRUD. Locations
  enforce a single-default-per-org invariant (moving the default is
  transactional); deleting a location is blocked if it's the org's last
  one, its current default, or still holds inventory. Suppliers/customers
  block deletion once they have order history.
- `GET /api/inventory` — stock query layer over `InventoryItem`, filterable
  by location/product.
- **StockMovement engine** (`POST /api/stock-movements`,
  `POST /api/stock-movements/transfer`, `GET /api/stock-movements`):
  RECEIVE, SALE, ADJUSTMENT, and a transactional TRANSFER_OUT/TRANSFER_IN
  pair. `InventoryItem.quantity` is now only ever mutated inside the same
  transaction as the StockMovement row that explains the change (via a
  shared `applyMovementDelta` helper in `lib/inventory.ts`), and every path
  rejects a result that would take stock negative. This is the audit-trail
  backbone the NFR in PRD §7 calls for.
- **Purchase orders** (F6): draft → ordered → received, with partial
  receiving. Receiving posts a RECEIVE movement per line and auto-advances
  status to PARTIALLY_RECEIVED or RECEIVED. Creation/editing/cancelling is
  Owner-gated; receiving is open to any authenticated user.
- **Sales orders** (F7): draft → fulfilled, with an over-sell guard —
  every line's stock at the order's location is checked before any
  movement is posted, so a short line never partially fulfills. Left
  ungated by role (fulfilling sales orders is an explicit Staff task in
  the PRD's persona model, unlike PO management).
- **Dashboard** (F8/F9): `GET /api/dashboard/summary` (total stock value,
  active product count, low-stock count, 10 most recent movements) and
  `GET /api/dashboard/low-stock` (paginated, sorted by scarcity).
- 29 new backend tests (66 total, all passing), covering tenant isolation,
  the over-sell/negative-stock guards, and every status transition.

**Shipped (frontend, start of Day 7):**
- `DashboardPage` now calls the new dashboard endpoints instead of
  showing the Day-1 placeholder: stat cards (stock value, active
  products, low-stock count), a low-stock table, and a recent-activity
  feed.
- Verified in an actual browser (not just `tsc`/`vite build`): stood up a
  real local Postgres (see below), ran both dev servers, and drove
  signup → create product → RECEIVE stock → dashboard through
  Playwright, confirming the stat cards and tables reflect real data.

**Next (rest of Day 7, then Day 8-9):** Frontend screens for the
StockMovement engine, purchase orders, and sales orders — currently only
Products and the dashboard have UI; Locations/Suppliers/Customers/
Inventory/StockMovements/PurchaseOrders/SalesOrders are backend-only so
far. After that: CSV import/export and the sales/stock trend report in
the Python service (Day 10-11).

**Blockers/decisions:**
- **No Docker daemon in this sandbox either**, but `postgresql-16` is
  installed locally and unused — started it directly
  (`pg_ctlcluster 16 main start`), created a `stockroom` role/database
  matching `backend/.env.example`, and ran the first
  `prisma migrate dev` (now committed under `backend/prisma/migrations/`).
  That migration didn't exist before this session; every real deploy
  needs it to run `prisma migrate deploy` instead of `db push`. Local dev
  without Docker: start the cluster, then follow `backend/.env.example`.
- PO create/edit/cancel is Owner-only; PO receiving and all sales-order
  actions are open to any authenticated user. This mirrors the PRD's
  persona text (Owner "manages suppliers and purchase orders", Staff
  "receives stock, fulfills sales orders") rather than any single
  functional requirement, since F1-F9 don't spell out per-endpoint RBAC.
- Deliberately did **not** hide cost/margin fields from STAFF on the new
  dashboard endpoint. The persona section says Staff has "no access to
  cost/margin data by default," but Day 1's Products endpoints already
  return full cost data to any authenticated org member — hiding it on
  just the one new endpoint would be an inconsistent, half-applied rule.
  Real field-level RBAC needs to land everywhere at once; that's exactly
  what Day 13 ("RBAC hardening") in the plan is for, so left as-is until
  then and flagged here rather than silently skipped.
- Low-stock math compares a product's *summed* quantity across all
  locations to its (location-agnostic) `reorderPoint`, since `reorderPoint`
  is a product-level field in the current schema, not per-location. Revisit
  if/when per-location reorder points are needed.
- Dashboard aggregation (`lib` in `dashboard.routes.ts`) sums stock in JS
  rather than a SQL `groupBy`, because the mock Prisma client used in tests
  can't express `groupBy`. Fine at the ~10k SKU scale the NFR targets;
  flagged in a code comment as the spot to move to a real aggregate query
  if that changes.

## Day 7 (finish) — 2026-08-15

**Planned:** Finish Day 7 ("Frontend: auth pages, app shell, products &
inventory screens") — every Day 2-6 backend endpoint (Locations, Suppliers,
Customers, Inventory, StockMovements) was still backend-only.

**Shipped (frontend):**
- `LocationsPage`: list, create, delete, and switch the org's default
  location (the "make default" action calls the existing `PATCH
  /locations/:id { isDefault: true }`, which server-side clears the old
  default transactionally).
- `SuppliersPage` / `CustomersPage`: near-identical search + create + delete
  screens, mirroring `ProductsPage`'s existing layout and form conventions.
- `InventoryPage`: read-only stock-on-hand table, filterable by location,
  over `GET /inventory`.
- `StockMovementsPage`: two forms — record a RECEIVE/SALE/ADJUSTMENT
  movement (ADJUSTMENT requires a reason, matching the backend's own
  validation) and transfer stock between two locations — plus a movement
  history table. Both forms invalidate the `inventory` and `dashboard`
  query caches on success so other open screens stay in sync.
- `AppShell` nav extended with Inventory, Stock Movements, Locations,
  Suppliers, Customers; new protected routes wired into `App.tsx`.
- Extended `fetchProducts` to accept a `{ pageSize }` option (needed to pull
  a full product list for the stock-movement form's `<select>`) without
  breaking its existing `search?: string` call sites.

**Verified:** `tsc --noEmit` and the full Jest suite (66/66) on the backend
(no backend changes this session, confirmed as a baseline), `pytest` on the
python-service, and `tsc -b && vite build` on the frontend — all clean.
Beyond the build/test commands, stood up a real local Postgres (same
`pg_ctlcluster 16 main start` + role/db setup as Day 2-6, this sandbox has
no Docker either) and drove the new screens with Playwright end-to-end:
signup → create two locations → switch the default → delete a throwaway
location → create a supplier and a customer → create a product → receive
20 units at one location → transfer 8 units to a second location →
confirmed the Inventory page reads back 12/8 correctly and the Dashboard
still loads. No console or network errors other than the expected
favicon 404.

**Next (Day 8):** Frontend purchase-order and sales-order flows — these are
the two remaining backend-only surfaces. They're a bigger lift than today's
CRUD screens (multi-line order forms, status-transition actions like
order/receive/fulfill/cancel, partial receiving), so left for the next
session rather than rushing a shallow version of both in the time left
here.

**Blockers/decisions:**
- Went with simple delete buttons (no confirm dialog) for
  Locations/Suppliers/Customers rows, consistent with how minimal
  `ProductsPage` already is (no edit UI at all yet). The backend's own
  guardrails (can't delete the last/default location, can't delete a
  supplier/customer with order history) are the actual safety net; a
  confirm-dialog is cheap UI polish that can land anytime and isn't
  blocking anything.
- `StockMovementsPage`'s history table has no pagination controls yet even
  though the backend supports `page`/`pageSize` — fine at today's data
  volumes; revisit alongside Day 13's general polish pass if it becomes a
  problem before then.
